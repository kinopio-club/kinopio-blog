      "title": "About Page",
      "content_html": "<p>New visitors to kinopio (and search engine robots) will see a new static <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/about\">About Kinopio</a> page when visiting the site.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/hero.webp\" class=\"wide\">\n<p>For everyone else, opening the website, or the app, will open your last space, just like it did before.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/flowchart.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<p>Philosophical, this is a big change from the original behaviour of greeting new users directly with the <code>Hello Kinopio</code> space. So I wanted to write a bit here about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> we did it.</p>\n<p>Radically removing friction by skipping the marketing page helped some people fall in love with the app, but had some issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From a user perspective: people who already understood what Kinopio is, and why they should use it, enjoyed being able to jump right in, but the majority of people had to figure that out while also learning a new interface.</li>\n<li>From a sustainable biz perspective, Kinopio’s biggest challenge is reaching new users (i.e. distribution). Google Search rarely shows Kinopio to people looking for whiteboarding, mind-mapping etc. because its crawlers can’t understand spaces (which are dynamically generated).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Technical Details</h1>\n<p>Over the last month, <a href=\"https://lucas.love\">Lucas</a> and I re-architected the app to be able to compile static pages that could be crawled by search engines.</p>\n<p>Just like how succinct, clear, writing takes more effort, it took a lot of time to find the right approach that didn’t compromise the clarity of the Vue/Vite codebase.</p>\n<p>We captured our goals and findings in a <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/vike-vue-notes-7k41MNfYhkzbXFUYyul1s\">space</a>,</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/vite-ssg-space.webp\" class=\"wide\">\n<p>Then we built prototypes using different approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Vike</code>: I sort of got this to work, but hit a brick wall. Vike uses node to compile files (not Vite), and I couldn't register a Pinia plugin (which we need for websocket handling) because those use @alias-ed paths, which are not supported by Vike config files.</li>\n<li><code>Nuxt</code>: basically a replacement for using Vue/Vite directly in favor of a comprehensive and opinionated set of build and debugging tools. Our prototype revealed that this was the least maintainable option because in the Nuxt world breaking API changes are common, and you can’t do small upgrades of internal systems because packages like Vue/Vite are completely subsumed by it. Also while we were evaluating it, the project was acquired by Vercel, which has a history of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">enshittifying</a> projects. I think we dodged a bullet.</li>\n<li><code>Vite-SSG</code> is what we ended up going with. It’s a relatively simple solution designed only for compiling static pages from within our existing Vue/Vite setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Designing the Marketing Site</h1>\n<p>I have a long history of making marketing pages. Years ago, when I worked at Freshbooks, I coded up the marketing sites for their small business accounting software. These were based on the desktop sized mockups made by their design team. Later on, at FogCreek/Glitch, I designed and built the last versions of their corporate homepage, and did the marketing pages for new products.</p>\n<p>It’s another challenge entirely to build a marketing website for your own product though. Ironically, the more passionate I am about something, the harder it is to explain it to other people.</p>\n<p>The design goals for the Kinopio marketing website were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicate <em>what</em> Kinopio is, <em>how</em> to use it, and <em>why</em> I made it, and <em>why</em> you should use it.</li>\n<li>Stand out from the status quo enterprise-oriented <a href=\"https://pketh.org/towards-a-better-whiteboard.html\">software whiteboards</a>, which all look the same, and say the same generic teamwork/productivity things.</li>\n<li>Feel like just another part of the app, using the same colors, typefaces, sizes, and overall feel.</li>\n<li>Show &gt; Tell where possible. While still being understandable to Search Robots.</li>\n<li>Intrigue and reassure just enough to encourage you to click the <code>Open Kinopio</code> button to jump into the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>An Easter Egg in the Intro Video</h1>\n<p>I really wracked my brain on what to show in the intro/hero video at the top of the page. I wanted it to be a video of the real UI in use, rather than something polished but fake created with a professional video editing tool.</p>\n<p>For the video, I recreated the space from the first mockup of Kinopio I ever made:</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/4251114\">\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/og.webp\" class=\"wide\">\n</a>\n<p>Then it was just a painful process of trial and error to make a series of smooth specific edits.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/vid.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<h1>Special Features</h1>\n<p>One of my favorite things about using <code>Vite-SSG</code> is that I can mix in components and features from the real app, like the Apps and Pricing dialogs.</p>\n<p>I especially like how the Explore/Live buttons in the footer <code>shows &gt; tells</code> new users about the awesome Kinopio community way more than words ever could.</p>\n<p>P.S. Toggling dark mode works on the page too.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/about-page/footer.webp\" class=\"\">\n<hr>\n<p>Anywho, although we’re doing all these technical backflips to reach new people, there’s still nothing better than word of mouth. So if you enjoy using Kinopio, be sure to tell your friends about it!</p>\n",

But also, I winced when I saw performance buckling under the weight of 500 card long connected conversation trees, giant images, organized across 30+ boxes, card voting, colors, and six or so different header fonts in use. </p>\n<p>As usual, I'll list the big new features below. But the updates I'm most proud of are the extensive performance optimizations that collaborating in these gigantic spaces pushed me to do. </p>\n<p>If you use Kinopio everyday it's easy to not notice now because it's the new normal, but every interaction, from clicking to create new cards, paint selecting, and editing cards is easily over 2✕ faster than it was a year ago.</p>\n<h2>What's New</h2>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.kinopio.club/_-rhwVAiOkxEHS3DbMLb7/offline.webp\" alt=\"\" />\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Offline Support lets you work in a subway, plane, or uncharted rainforest.

The use-cases here are taking notes, planning, and collaborating. A couple of people have asked about team plans where many people can easily share team spaces and be billed together.</p>\n<p>This path also prioritizes long-planned features like <a href=\"https://forum.kinopio.club/t/planning-card-lists-or-maybe-named-card-stacks/276\">Lists</a>, and other collaborative workflow features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The good news it that work on teams has begun. Those in the <a href=\"https://help.kinopio.club/posts/teams\">Kinopio for Teams beta program</a> can create teams, invite and manage team members, and assign team spaces.

But there was a <em>lot</em> of trial and error needed to find the ones that worked well together, and could set an atmosphere while still being flexible enough to cover every use-case.</p>\n<p>These aren't the standard google/adobe fonts that you'll find everywhere else – each one is special in it's own way:</p>\n<h2>Apris</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://www.schick-toikka.com/apris\">Schick Toikka</a>, Berlin, Germany</p>\n<p>Funky, energetic, channeling the spirit of 1970s design, Apris has a real <em>&quot;let's go!&quot;</em> kind of energy.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/1b-apris.webp\" class=\"\">\n<h2>Gaya</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://www.writtenshape.com/fonts/gaya\">Writtenshape</a>, Paris, France</p>\n<p>Wavy, soft, and inviting, if you were writing with a pen filled with honey you might end up with something as sweet as Gaya.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/2-gaya.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>GroteskRemix</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://www.bb-bureau.fr\">bb-bureau</a>, Paris, France</p>\n<p>Not gonna lie, I discovered this font from the end credits of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_(2024_TV_series)\">Mr. and Mrs. Smith</a> on amazon. GroteskRemix is unlike anything else, but in the right contexts, especially on dark backgrounds, it can be really sophisticated and technical.</p>\n<p>(p.s. don't sleep on the <code>## h2</code> variant of GroteskRemix)</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/3-groteskremix.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>GT America</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america\">Grilli Type</a>, Lucerne, Switzerland</p>\n<p>I also wanted to provide a modern, professional sans-serif font that's ideal for use in serious planning and work spaces. It's authoritative without being authoritarian – a surprisingly fine line in the world of fonts.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/4-gt-america.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>Microgramma</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgramma_%28typeface%29\">URW Type Foundry</a>, Turin, Italy</p>\n<p>Technical, space-age, utopic – microgramma is from a past where people were optimistic about the potential of new technology to improve our lives, like microchips and microwaves. If you're trying to make a better world, it's a fun place to start.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/5-microgramma.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>Migra</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://pangrampangram.com/products/migra\">Pangram Pangram</a></p>\n<p>Migra has brush-like edges like the kind you'd find in ornate monastic texts – but because those edges are also geometric, it works well in modern spaces too.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/6-migra.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>Recoleta</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://www.latinotype.com\">Latinotype</a>, Chile, Peru</p>\n<p>This is the previous/current default header font so it's probably the most familiar. It's still a great choice that really shines in personal spaces.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/7-recoleta.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n<h2>Shinka-Mono</h2>\n<p>Foundry: <a href=\"https://aeiou.tools/typeface/shinka-mono\">Aeiou Tools</a>, Passenans, France</p>\n<p>Originally, Kinopio used a version of Osaka-Mono that I hand-customized to work better with english punctuation as it's only font. But I eventually let it go so the app would work better for people in Asia and other non-latin countries. Shinka-Mono, designed to look like the english glyphs in Japanese fonts, is reminiscent of those experimental days.</p>\n<p>Monospace fonts aren't just for programmers, they're for every creator.</p>\n<img src=\"/assets/posts/header-fonts/8-shinka-mono.webp\" class=\"medium\">\n",

I'm really sorry for the issue, and I'll write up a full retrospective of this issue in the next bulletin or blog post</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Three days later, the problems were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1772326592603136466\">fixed</a>, and since then <a href=\"https://lucas.love/\">Lucas</a> and I overhauled the server and database to make them substantially faster and more reliable.</p>\n<p>For example, downloading a space used to take ~5s, and now takes ~100ms. And issues with cards and connections not correctly saving their positions were fixed, so no more errant connection lines.</p>\n<h1>More Details</h1>\n<p>This whole affair was a big learning experience for me, especially in the low level details of how databases work. Including some painful lessons about the dangers of relying on Sequelize's automatic sync.</p>\n<p>While I worked with Lucas to understand the problem, I captured all my notes in <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/db-debugging-and-tasks---mar-24---apr-rOi8bPSTBX6F5dlC3rYLe\">this space</a>. But basically, two totally separate bugs worked together to take down the server:</p>\n<h2>1. A Client Sync Bug</h2>\n<p>In some conditions, the client app would send update operations in the wrong order (e.g. trying to create a connection, before the connectionType it belongs to being created), causing the database to throw errors.</p>\n<p>These thrown errors weren't being properly <code>catch</code>ed and would crash the server. When the client found out that it's operation request failed, it would retry it, again causing the server to throw the same error and crash repeatedly.</p>\n<p>The solution was to overhaul the logging and error handling systems.</p>\n<h2>2. And a Database Sync Bug</h2>\n<p>In prior jobs, I've had to use things like Rails' Active Record Migrations anytime I needed to make any change to the database. It was a manual and laborious process. So when I learned that Sequelize could automatically sync the state of the database to reflect it's model files it felt like a magical slam dunk. And it was, until now.</p>\n<p>For better and worse, there is nothing magic about databases. Turns out that whenever Sequelize was doing those automatic syncs on boot it was adding new table indexes each time. When the server started crashing and restarting, more and more of these indexes kept getting generated. Eventually reading and writing to the database became so slow that Heroku would restart the app thinking it had crashed... which of course caused even more indexes to be created, until the app could no longer even start under it's accrued weight.</p>\n<p>The solution was to clean out all those garbage indexes, and build the infrastructure to use safer but slower manual migrations for db updates going forward.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The lessons I learned from this week won't soon be forgotten. We're monitoring the server and aggressively scrubbing out bits of gunk and cobwebs to prevent something like this from happening again.</p>\n<p>But also, it feels good to know that everything in the machine is humming along nicely now, and that my server debugging skills have really levelled up.</p>\n",

In the past people have requested <code>.opml</code> support for similar reasons. But while <code>.opml</code> is great for outliners and simple mindmaps, it falls apart when you use it to represent multiple trees that can share child nodes.</p>\n<p>The canvas spec is a much better fit because it can represent these structures. I think it'll function a lot better as a unified open base for people to build their own converters for other spatial tools too.</p>\n<p>While not every feature is supported by .canvas, the core content of cards, connections, and directions are. Some people would prefer the spec to support everything, but IMO they might not be considering that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Specs work best when they're simple and easy to understand and implement. Most people adding .canvas support right now are doing so altruistically, so it's important that those devs have a good time.</li>\n<li>There's a huge delta between tools in terms of feature sets and personalization capabilities, so focusing on the parts that they all share is a lot more productive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're curious here's a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pketh/fecfb9644abdd663006933fc95173520\">code snippet</a> showing how the app converts <code>.canvas</code> files into kinopio's json space format.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>This year-end bulletin will be a little different. I hope this look forward is interesting.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it blows my mind that I made Kinopio, and it works, and that people use it everyday. As glass-blowers, pottery-makers, wood-workers, and farmers already know, it's life-affirming to sell something you created with your own hands to someone else.</p>\n<p>That said, &quot;I've built a lot and I'm super tired&quot; is the only real feeling in my head right now. But I'll push myself just a little bit farther and tell you about the paralyzing fork in the road that I find myself at.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/33-1.webp\" class=\"wide\"></p>\n<p>One possible path forward is towards the potentially more profitable B2B needs of small teams. Although I didn't design Kinopio primarily for work, I've noticed that the most use happens during work hours. The use cases here are taking notes, planning, and collaborating. A couple of people have asked about team plans where many people can easily share team spaces and be billed together.</p>\n<p>This biz path prioritizes features like <a href=\"https://club.kinopio.club/t/planning-card-lists/276/40\">Lists</a>, and other collaborative workflow features. But going too far, too fast, down this road risks compromising the cool parts of Kinopio for everyone else. </p>\n<p>The second path focuses on the consumer-side that's starting to work, with more writing, memorable marketing, and great documentation. You'll see more community and personalization features like user pages, frames, and physical swag/stickers.</p>\n<p>The choice is paralyzing.</p>\n<p>Fortunately there's another path forward. obscured by brambles, snaking right between the two extremes. The fork isn't completely divergent and there's a lot of overlap between them.</p>\n<p>Now that we've firmly arrived in metaphor town, lets stop by the local coffee shop:</p>\n<img src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/33-2.webp\" class=\"wide\">\n<p>Most people are here to buy coffee, one small cup at a time – kind of like a subscription. A much smaller group of people love coffee but prefer to pay more for a large bag of beans that they can brew on their own terms – kind of like the lifetime plan added this year.</p>\n<p>But most coffee shops don't stop there. They also sell pastries, sandwiches, and sweaters. Critically, adding these to the menu doesn't make the coffee worse.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I believe that there's room to make Kinopio appeal to different markets, like teams, without compromising the qualities of the core product.</p>\n<p>Stretching this analogy till it snaps, over the last 4~ years, the beans have been planted and grown, and the cafe building has been constructed plank by plank, chair by chair. I'm behind the counter now and it's immensely rewarding seeing new faces come in.</p>\n<p>Some will become regulars and stay for years, some will visit once in a blue moon, some will peek in and immediately turn around.</p>\n<p>But all are welcome.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/33-3.webp\" class=\"\"></p>\n",

This comes with some implications that power-users who are already using space links should know about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The height of cards with a space link is now a little taller, so some tightly packed layouts are gonna need to be manually cleaned up.</li>\n<li>To avoid disrupting existing layouts as much as possible, your existing space link cards won’t have image previews. You’ll need to toggle them on inside the card.</li>\n<li>The linked space also needs to have a space preview image generated, which you can do by visiting the space at least once. Each time you visit the space the preview will be regenerated. That said, it might take up to 5 minutes before your shows you the latest generated version.</li>\n<li>Eventually the plan is to use these generated images in more places, like on an explore page and for URL unfurls in other apps.</li>\n<li>Previews are generated using light theme colors. If there's demand for dark mode previews let me know and I'll add that in the future.</li>\n</ul>\n",

This performance improvement was one of those.</p>\n<p>As you may know, the <a href=\"https://pketh.org/how-kinopio-is-made.html\">kinopio-client</a> app that runs in your browser uses Vue.js to manage and update state.</p>\n<p>The <code>x,y</code> position of cards in the currentSpace is tracked in state so that when card positions change, the computed methods in many other components that depend on the position of cards can automatically recompute themselves. (aka <code>data-binding</code>)</p>\n<p>But the magic of data-binding becomes a liability when an item is updating it's state 60 times a second (<code>60fps</code>) – such as when you drag a card around the screen. And if 10 cards are being dragged together, that's 60 × 10 updates a second.</p>\n<p>As you might imagine, all this dependency recomputing and repainting can overwhelm the browser causing frame rate hitches.</p>\n<p>The way to get around this issue is to just not update state during these kinds of events. So while a card is being dragged, it's position is directly manipulated in the DOM in a very lo-fi way:</p>\n<pre><code>moveWhileDragging: (state, { cards }) =&gt; {\n    cards.forEach(card =&gt; {\n        const element = document.querySelector(`article[data-card-id=&quot;${card.id}&quot;]`)\n        element.style.left = card.x + 'px'\n        element.style.top = card.y + 'px'\n    })\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>And only after the drag is complete is the Vue state updated with the new card positions. Which means that all that expensive data-bound recomputing only needs to happen only once at the end.</p>\n",

But in the spirit of measuring twice and cutting once, it took me a while to figure out how best to build it.</p>\n<p>My implementation was inspired by <a href=\"https://shelby.cool/#/gradients\">Shelby Wilson's</a> gradient technique where 6 different radial gradients are layered on top of each other with alternating opacities. I recommend checking out her other <a href=\"https://shelby.cool/#\">web experiments</a> too.</p>\n<p>But actually drawing the gradients turned out to be the easy part. The Kinopio background system was originally built with two implicit assumptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a space <code>background</code> is an image URL.</li>\n<li>if no background is set, the space should use the default background image. This is because originally, backgrounds weren't customizable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Which was upended to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>spaces can have a <code>background</code> image url, but they can also have a <code>backgroundGradient</code> JSON object which describes the gradient layers. The space <code>backgroundIsGradient</code> boolean determines whether to draw the background with an image url or gradient. More info on these attributes is in the <a href=\"https://help.kinopio.club/api/\">API docs</a></li>\n<li>If no background is set, the space uses a blank background instead. I think this is a more intuitive behaviour for new users.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Which is planned for many years, likely decades.</p>\n<img class=\"\" src=\"https://kinopio-updates.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/lifetime-price.png\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>As always, your support is deeply appreciated. Upgrading helps kinopio be economically-sustainable, bootstrapped, <a href=\"https://pketh.org/organic-software.html\">organic software</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n<p>A one-time purchase option has been requested a number of times, but I've gone back and forth on whether I should provide it…</p>\n<p>On one hand, because Kinopio is web software that uses a server to enable things like sharing and collaborating on spaces, and that server has an ongoing cost to keep running, recurring subscriptions are the most sustainable option.</p>\n<p>However that being said, subscriptions carry a negative connotation for those who've been burned by Adobe and similarly greedy companies that use dark patterns to hold your data hostage with hidden cancellation fees – while also continually raising prices.</p>\n<p>That Kinopio subscriptions have never, and will never, do these things isn't something you'd assume if you've been screwed over before.</p>\n<p>So this new plan exists in the spirit of inviting people in and giving them options. It's my hope that this encourages more people to pay for Kinopio, but also to tell their friends about the cool new tool they bought. And maybe in the farther future, if they wanted to purchase some swag, or make a donation, that could be cool too :)</p>\n<img class=\"\" style=\"width: 80px\" src=\"https://kinopio-updates.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/entrance.gif\">\n<h3>About the Price</h3>\n<p>My initial plan was to charge $150, 2.5× the yearly price. But when I put the number into the actual Upgrade UI I was worried that it <em>felt</em> too low. So I asked what people thought on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8\">Discord</a>. In response, <a href=\"https://social.lol/@thomasohashi\">thomasyo</a> posted this, which captured the user perspective better than I could have and pushed me to $200.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take this with a grain of salt because it's more of a feeling than something I have evidence for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically I think you kind of want to incentivize people to subscribe rather than take the lifetime option right? $150 is still high enough that it probably achieves that, but I think $200 doesn't sound outrageous and would give you more leeway in the long run maybe? My perception of people who want lifetime options aren't so much looking for discounts as they are religiously against subscriptions, so they'd be willing to pay more. I'm not suggesting this to soak your customers but rather to make sure that you have enough revenue to keep it going. Like what if a bunch of people take the lifetime option and new subscriptions stall after two years? I have no idea what your financials look like and I'm not an expert but it's abstractly something I would worry about as a potential customer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From my perspective as a user, if I'm going to invest my time and energy into Kinopio then I want to feel confident that it won't go away. Having too low of a lifetime price for something kind of makes me uneasy about its long term viability. That's usually fine for something that just fulfills a specific function, but in this context I sort of assume that I keep paying for the service and you keep improving it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, to be clear, I'm mostly speaking generally about how I perceive subscriptions and lifetime options. I was following your work long before I started using Kinopio and I really appreciate how candid you've been about it so I do not personally feel concerned the way I might if I didn't know anything about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Kinopio makes it easy to save code snippets and give them context for reference spaces, engineering diagrams, and decision trees.</p>\n<p>When you paste code into cards between <code> triple backticks</code>, your code will get syntax highlighting. You can either type the language name after the backticks (e.g. ```js), or select it from the list.</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"wide\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/better-code-blocks.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<p>Relatedly, to accommodate larger code snippets, cards with ``` triple backticks can hold more characters (2000).</p>\n<p>(Also new is a Copy code button for easily pasting code into your text editor)</p>\n<p>\n<video class=\"\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/bigger-code-blocks.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<h2>Backstory</h2>\n<p>Implementing syntax highlighting was not straightforward. Initially, I thought I had two choices:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a robust syntax highlighting library that runs in the browser. Which is the fastest and most-straightforward solution, but these libraries are usually 250kb or more – so significantly larger than the rest of Kinopio (and computationally heavy).</li>\n<li>Use that library on the server instead. This would keep the bloat out of the browser, but I'd have to deal with the lag-time between updating code and having it's highlighted syntax. This would also put more strain on the server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I didn't love either solution, but was leaning towards #2 because it kept things fastest for the user. Design is often about choosing the least bad tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>Then, I received an email from <a href=\"https://david.tools/ipfs/QmcmSwqEsgscyHbQ4Vi37dhbUTsefA4qRg78wMqKkxzv3L/\">David Francisco</a>, whom I'd once interviewed for a job at Glitch. I'm glad he kept in touch because he gave me a suggestion that led me to <a href=\"https://github.com/xyzshantaram/macrolight\">macrolight</a>, a tiny and not-at-all robust syntax highlighting library.</p>\n<p>This made me rethink my whole approach.</p>\n<p>Syntax highlighting in Kinopio doesn't need the vscode-level accuracy that the popular libraries provide – speed and size matter more here.</p>\n<img class=\"wide\" src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/codeblocks-wip.png\">\n<p>So combined with some of my own <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pketh/b80e1a6593829a9d690ea78e0efdca77\">custom language grammers</a>, I was able to add the good enough + very fast syntax highlighting support that I didn't know I was looking for.</p>\n",

And – if you're so inclined – you can <a href=\"https://pketh.org/kinopio-ios.html\">read about how it was made</a> too.</p>\n<p>Besides the new app, it's been a packed couple of months. There's a couple new features, a bunch of little performance and quality-of-life improvements, and a lot of boring-but-fundamental infrastructure improvements that'll keep Kinopio running fast and reliably for years to come.</p>\n<h2>Also New</h2>\n<p>\n<video class=\"wide\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/card-text-editor-keyboard-enter-shortcuts.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/card-text-editor/\">Card Text Editor</a> lets you edit your cards linearly as if they were paragraphs blocks.</li>\n<li>For those who work in dark mode (<code>t</code>), there are new <a href=\"https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/dark-backgrounds/\">Dark Background variants</a> for every built-in space background to keep things easy on the eyes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<video class=\"wide\" autoplay loop muted playsinline>\n  <source src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/connection-highlighting.mp4\">\n</video>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost:8082/posts/connection-highlighting/\">Improved Connection Highlighting</a> helps guide your eye and visually untangle busy spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Uploaded files are now served from CDN urls, which means that your cards will load just as fast in Jakarta as they do in Brooklyn.</li>\n<li>Speaking of 🌍, the billing system was totally rewritten to work better internationally. You can also now update your billing details and payment method anytime (<code>User → Settings → Billing and Credits → Customer Portal</code>)</li>\n<li>10x performance improvement of loading spaces which have a lot space and card links in them. (Like <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/-2023-humdrum-zxU5zQtON09eepqKhJrhG\">this one</a>)</li>\n<li>The browser extension and iOS share sheet have a cleaner design that loads faster and takes up less space</li>\n<li>you can now change your email and password while signed in via <code>User → Settings → Account</code></li>\n<li>When naming boxes, the input field now grows as your type to make it easier to write long box names (also fixes an issue where the 1Password browser extension would try and autofill the field like a password)</li>\n<li>Card links no longer display their space at the top of the card card for a more compact appearance.</li>\n<li>The <code>Pricing</code> button in the header is now always visible unless you upgrade (before it'd go away after Sign In, but enough people couldn't find it when they needed it)</li>\n<li>Free card limit progress is moved to <code>Pricing</code></li>\n<li>A <code>back</code> button next to your current space in the header for jumping to your previously visited space in the current session.

Core parts like <code>node.js</code>, <code>bcrypt</code>, <code>sequelize</code> were upgraded to modern versions, and old libraries and other gunk was cleaned out. Shockingly, it seems to have gone quite smoothly.</li>\n<li>The browser back button now works reliability, especially for signed out users</li>\n<li>Align and Distribute commands now calculate positions correctly when zoomed out</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Works and Experiments in Progress</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Invite read-only viewers to private spaces</li>\n<li>Faster image uploads / HEIC file support</li>\n<li>Customizable card h1/h2 fonts</li>\n<li>Card tilting</li>\n<li>Lines: A totally new tool for organizing your spaces</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A Call for Friends of Kinopio</h2>\n<p>If you've read it this far then you must be quite special.</p>\n<p>If you're interested in building an audience by blogging, video-ing, or podcast-ing about Kinopio – and getting an exclusive user badge and cool stickers – then maybe the <em>Friends-of-Kinopio</em> Ambassador program is for you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/ambassador-space-cropped.png\" class=\"\">\n<p>There's only 5 spots left though, so <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/friends-of-kinopio-ambassadors-YNmS6C3fofN3R9mYgO1Bu\">check out this space</a> to learn more and join the club.</p>\n",

From transclusion, mirroring, portals, block references, synced blocks, and even (I kid you not) Synced Figure Instances.</p>\n<p>But the last thing I wanted to do is build something impressive sounding that only power-users would understand. Everyone knows what a URL is so I just used that. Being just a regular link, you can paste it anywhere.</p>\n<p>The format is also pretty simple, so you can even construct it yourself:</p>\n<p><code>https://kinopio.club/SPACE_ID/CARD_ID</code></p>\n<p>I'm hoping that, because card links are so flexible and approachable, people find creative and surprising new uses for them.</p>\n<h1>Building on Vacation</h1>\n<p>Most of the development work for this happened over 3+ weeks while I was on vacation in the Phillipines. With all the client-app refactoring and server plumbing involved, this probably wasn't the smartest project to tackle while constrained to a small laptop screen.</p>\n<img src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/vacation.jpg\"/>\n<p>But now that it's finally out there, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

      "content_html": "<p>Hi friends,</p>\n<p>I’ve been thinking for a while about how to grow awareness for Kinopio, and I keep coming back to the same problem. People start using Kinopio primarily because they enjoy the design and the interactions, and secondly because of the problems it solves for them – but to draw new people in, this also needs to happen the other way around. Something like,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kinopio solves problem X that you have, by doing Y</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leading with the reason to use something makes it easier for people to invite themselves in. One of my favorite examples of this is “<a href=\"https://readwise.com\">Readwise</a> helps you remember what you read, by periodically surfacing your highlights”.</p>\n<p>I like how tight and focused this is. But I struggle here because people use Kinopio to take notes, plan, mood-board, journal, and even make webpages in. Does choosing to highlight one of these as <em>the</em> primary use turn the others into second class citizens?</p>\n<p>\n<img class=\"wide\" src=\"https://kinopio-blog.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/28-3.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</p>\n<p>Another way to go is aligning with an established productivity category, like white-boarding or mind-mapping. People already know if they need these and what problems they solve. But again, there’s not one category that completely fits.</p>\n<p>But also I’m not really interested in productivity as the end-goal. I didn’t create Kinopio to be a better whiteboard, or a better Miro/Mural/etc. This all started because I noticed that I felt mentally and creatively free when I wrote and moved my thoughts around using the text tool in design software. I thought that other people might enjoy this too, in a streamlined and more approachable form.</p>\n<p>It’s not a grand vision, there’s no market disruption, there’s not even any AI, I must be a loser.</p>\n<p>So back to the original question, what’s the problem to be solved? If Readwise helps you remember, then I think Kinopio helps you express yourself and make sense of your ideas.</p>\n<p>Express yourself how? Here’s what I’ve seen,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some people share their spaces with their teams or classes, to present an idea more engagingly or to jam towards new insight together.</li>\n<li>Others share their spaces with the world, in the form of personal websites, portfolios, and even storefronts.</li>\n<li>But most people share their spaces with themselves. Self-expression is a thing we do for ourselves most of all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So after all that, here’s what I’ve got:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kinopio helps you express yourself and turn ideas into understanding</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<hr>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"badge info\">What's New</span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <img class=\"small\" src=\"https://updates.kinopio.club/transparent-connections-to-comments.png\" alt=\"\" />\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/connections-to-comments//\">Connections to Comments</a>, To make it easier for your eye to follow connected ideas in busy spaces, connection lines appear transparent when connected to a comment card.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/search-backgrounds/\">Search backgrounds</a>, to find the perfect background for your space</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/refer-a-friend/\">Refer a friend</a>, and earn a month of free credits for everyone you refer who signs up</li>\n  <li>Also, we've started holding office hours in the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8\">Community Discord</a>, every <b>Tuesday at 12pm EST</b>.

To that end – inspired by this computer case <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering/_img/6399cd15132d7e0af3c8620c_original.pdf\">assembly guide</a> – I wanted the ability to build a grid for displaying sequences of step-by-step instructions.</p>\n<p>As humans we intuitively know when two things are <code>close</code> to each other. But programming closeness presents many little problems, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does closeness <em>actually</em> mean? These two boxes have <code>x</code> values that are very similar, but the boxes are not what you'd perceive as close.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"narrow\" src=\"https://kinopio-blog.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/box-snap-close-x.svg\">\n<p>I'm using a combination of proximity (the distance between two matching side points, such as the center-left side of one box and the center-right side of another), as well as x or y axis distance.

There's plenty of other apps that have zoom afterall. The short version is that there's different styles of zoom: <code>center 0,0</code> and <code>top-left 0,0</code>.</p>\n<img class=\"narrow\" src=\"https://kinopio-blog.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/zoom-center-origin.svg\">\n<p><code>Center</code> zooming allows cards to have negative coordinate positions and is fully unbounded and unlimited. The advantage of this system is that content can be put anywhere you want and the math is relatively straightforward.</p>\n<p>One downside though is that you're more likely to lose your position and need a minimap to reorient yourself. But the biggest impact of losing the constraint of a traditional page is … losing that constraint. The boundaries of a page is familiar and reassuring – they shape how we organize information, and make it easier to create share-able spaces.</p>\n<img class=\"narrow\" src=\"https://kinopio-blog.us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/zoom-left-origin.svg\">\n<p><code>Top-Left</code> zooming relies on the principles of regular webpage document.

I can quickly move things around and reorder on a whim without having to worry about organization. Then with a quick highlight and press of the alignment button, poof, neatly organized once again.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I can’t talk about these spaces without talking about <a href=\"https://help.kinopio.club/posts/backlinks/\">Links</a>.

Both my TV and Movie space are linked to in my <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/-the-central-hub-nTfUzCV1vnLedTHiWGWcE\">Media hub space</a>, which links to other media spaces, and is also linked to from even more spaces.</p>\n<p>With the new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1527978737731608576\">sidebar</a> it’s now super convenient to bounce around spaces, going higher or deeper in the hierarchy, making connections, and keeping track of things in a detailed, but easy manner.</p>\n",

I needed to take stock and organize everything I had seen, heard and produced. The idea of a road map, almost in the form of a mind map, corresponded well to the way a research project is organized (a guideline that breaks down into ideas). Kinopio is a perfect tool for that. Its simplicity allows to build very quickly something that works in its content as well as in its form.</p>\n<p>The text limits encourage you to be concise in what you want to write and adding links, images, colors or GIFs makes the place feels nice. As I worked on my road map, the idea of doing something <a href=\"https://help.kinopio.club/posts/sharing-spaces/\">shareable</a> came up.</p>\n<p>Now I think I will put a link to Kinopio in my project report. A tool that served as a help for me, will also be a good tool for future readers to get an overview of the project.</p>\n<h2>What are some important parts of a research presentation?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://us-east-1.linodeobjects.com/kinopio-uploads/xHnQRzyEpQWWW0E7u_dm6/roadmap-2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>First, the look.

I post a lot about it on my personal Instagram account, but because Instagram is so messy and a lot of the content disappears after 24 hours many of my friends don't have the opportunity to properly catch up with my skincare lore.</p>\n<p>On a space I can make it visually clear what my current routine is, and what I think of each product I use. That way when people ask me about my routine I can just redirect them to that space, its extremely convenient.</p>\n<h2>What are some important parts of a routine space?</h2>\n<img src=\"https://help.kinopio.club/assets/posts/guides/routine-4.png\" class=\"\">\n<p>First, it <em>must</em> be simple to update because the thing about skincare is that you change products and impressions about the products all the time.</p>\n<p>Second thing is structuring the skincare routine between day and night.</p>\n<p>I think third is offering honest reviews if you are interested in sharing the space with publicly.</p>\n<h2>How do you collect and organize info on your space?</h2>\n<img src=\"https://help.kinopio.club/assets/posts/guides/routine-5.png\" class=\"wide\">\n<p>I got all the images from my <a href=\"https://www.are.na/cucumber-salad\">are.na personal skincare channel</a>. I think the most important Kinopio feature for organising information on this space is the <a href=\"/posts/filters/\">filter</a>.</p>\n<p>I got the idea of making a filter by brand thing from a space made by <a href=\"https://kinopio.club/-the-central-hub-nTfUzCV1vnLedTHiWGWcE\">@humdrum</a> and I think its brilliant.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips of advice?</h2>\n<p>I think adding <a href=\"/posts/commenting/\">comments</a> is super useful because skincare has a lot of nuance and adding the comments make your impressions, intentions, and details about the routine clearer. I started adding the comments only a month after I was done with the space because I felt like some information could be misunderstood.</p>\n",

I also got lots of stuff from my old tumblr blog haha, I think that's a very specific source tho…</p>\n<h2>Any other tips or advice?</h2>\n<p>I think there's a kind of understanding of the tool that you only get after you use it for a while, or if you get in touch with people who understand it better. A way to really create a visually communicative space that's also easy to navigate. After I joined the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8\">Kinopio discord</a> and saw what ppl were doing there I completely changed my personal page layout and that was only possible because seeing other people's uses opened my mind to understanding Kinopio better.</p>\n",

It's basically my 'home' space on Kinopio.</p>\n<p>Whenever I've used traditional todo list apps, I'd inevitably hit a point where it feels like I'm buried under the weight of an infinite task list – that's usually when I'd usually start looking for another app, then repeat the problem all over again.</p>\n<p>My favorite thing about using a space for this instead is how the clutter of this space reflects the clutter of my mind.

      "content_html": "<h2>Why make a crochet diary?</h2>\n<p>I started learning to crochet in early 2022 as a way to continually build new skills, exercise creativity and have fun making stuff. Since there’s such an overwhelming amount of crocheting knowledge and patterns out there, I wanted to make a crochet diary to collect inspiration from around the web and document what I learned through each new project.</p>\n<p>Although popular crafting sites like <a href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/tour/getting-started\">Ravelry</a> exist, I wanted my space to be more casual since I’m still a newbie to this hobby. Plus I wanted my documentation to be a mini creative project in itself! Kinopio struck that perfect balance of being playful to use, while still having robust features for organizing my ideas.</p>\n<h2>What are some important parts of a crochet diary?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/12877138/original_7befcf8d8c3110051080fc364909380a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I wanted this space to have a mix of two things: structured areas to organize my projects, and unstructured mood-boarding to casually save ideas. It was important to strike this balance, as too much structure can get bureaucratic, but not enough becomes hard to navigate. The space also had to feel fun to maintain and update.</p>\n<h2>How do you collect and organize info on your space?</h2>\n<p>Usually I come across crochet patterns and inspiration on Instagram, YouTube and Etsy — the algorithms are serving me endless crochet projects! I save ideas I like under my “Wishlist” card, which acts like a bulletin board. The ideas just hang out there, and once I’m ready to begin a new project I’ll pick something from that collection.</p>\n<p>For projects, the space is organized like a kanban board. There’s a template of several cards at the top of my space that I copy when starting a new project. For each project, I’ll add cards with the crochet pattern/instructions, the yarn used, and any customizations I make along the way. I use tags to mark projects as current or finished. Once I’m finished, I use the “lock” feature for that project’s cards so that it stays put.</p>\n<h2>Any other tips or advice?</h2>\n<p>Use the Kinopio <a href=\"posts/extensions/\">browser extension</a> and <a href=\"/posts/apps/\">mobile app</a> shortcuts. I’m trying to get into the habit of saving inspiring links or images to Kinopio right away when I come across them, and then going in and organizing it later.</p>\n<p>Also, join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8\">Kinopio Discord</a>! I really like learning about new features as they roll out, and it’s helped inspire me to use Kinopio in new ways.</p>\n",
