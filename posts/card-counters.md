Add a numerical count to your cards for voting on ideas, to assign meanings like priority or status (eg 1 = x, 2 = y), or just to count things. It's a flexible tool for a muddy world.

# Implementation Notes

This feature was based on requests, feedback, and use-cases in the [support forum](https://club.kinopio.club/t/up-voting-cards-feature-request/378). I love paving [desire paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) to make them easier for everyone else to walk as well.
