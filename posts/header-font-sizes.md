# Backstory

Being able to increase header font sizes was a very recent community suggestion on Discord, stemming from some experiments simulating how this could look using custom CSS.

But I wasn't sure if I should ship this tbh. There's a tight-rope to walk between flexibility and ease. Too much flexibility adds friction to the thinking and writing experience because you lose momentum tweaking things to look *just* right. But being too rigid isn't great either because creativity is a fun and integral part of making spaces and being productive with Kinopio.

> So my advice is to use large sizes sparingly. Like salt, just a little pinch is all you need to season a dish. Use too much and you can make a meal (or the readability of your space) hard to digest.
