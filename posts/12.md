<p>In the last Bulletin, I asked for your thoughts on how to grow the audience for Kinopio. I was surprised how many responses and helpful ideas I received, which I captured in the <a href="https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ">Ideas for Growing Kinopio</a> space.</p>

<p>While I work towards all this, hereâ€™s a life anecdote in the meantime. Iâ€™ve been using the same keyboard for 11 years now, a <a href="https://materialjournal.com/blog/hhkb-hybrid-review">HHKB Professional 2</a>. Iâ€™m really drawn to the ideal of using and growing with tools through your life. Using something for so long, itâ€™s inevitably going to feel like an extension of your body.</p>

<p>That said, a year or so ago I bought a â€˜newâ€™ keyboard. Well actually, itâ€™s a <a href="https://shop.norbauer.com/products/the-heavy-grail-hhkb-housing?variant=32985987088438">new housing</a> that Iâ€™ll transplant the guts of my current keyboard into. I ordered mine in <span class="badge secondary">Sunset Blvd</span>:</p>

<p>Itâ€™s supposed to ship near the end of summer, so fingers crossed.</p>

  <span class="badge info">What's New</span>
</p>
<!-- ðŸ›¶ -->

<p>Iâ€™ve been slowly working my way towards a new launch. Iâ€™ve been refining the messaging around what Kinopio is, and simplifying the UI for new users.</p>

<p>This includes the new <span class="badge secondary">+</span> button that provides an upfront way to add new spaces, and integrating <span class="badge secondary">filters</span> into <span class="badge secondary">find</span>.</p>

</p>

<p>For more advanced users, you can now hold down <span class="badge secondary">shift</span> while painting to select and unselect cards.</p>

<p>But most importantly, we now have a <a href="https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8">Community Discord</a>. Come chat with us, share your favorite spaces, and ask questions.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve updated the <a href="https://kinopio.club/-kinopio-roadmap-6TRE21gchHI7alHLuwzd5">roadmap</a>, based on <a href="https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ">Ideas for Growing Kinopio</a>. (also with cool new graphics and music)</p>

</p>

<p>Next on the list is building an <a href="https://club.kinopio.club/t/about-marketing-page/357/7">about/marketing page</a> for people that prefer to read about what Kinopio is, etc. before diving in.</p>

<p>From my too-long career making marketing websites, my strategy is always to start with words. If you can make something clear and compelling with just text, then youâ€™ve got something worth building.</p>
