To make it easier to find cool new spaces and people, Explore has a new design with Following and Everyone.

I like the way that creator names and larger preview images work together to create that lively, messy, human feeling of community.

## Favoriting Spaces Also Streamlined

Favoriting spaces is now as easy as single clicking the `â™¥` button in the header. And you can find your favorite spaces and people in the `Sidebar`.

## Completing the Social Loop

Going forward, I want to use this to improve the Weekly Review emails, to make them more compelling and more readable. If you have any suggestions, definitely [let me know](mailto:hi@kinopio.club).
