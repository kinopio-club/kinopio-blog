## Why use Kinopio to track the TV shows you've watched and want to watch?

The goal of my [TV](https://kinopio.club/-2022-tv-space-ASdzyKj7YTRM5XQjwJErx) and [Movie](https://kinopio.club/-2022-movie-space-FOg4-Gs1LjALNSKXVBgQy) spaces is to have a quick place to see whatâ€™s out and available to watch and whatâ€™s coming out over the course of the year.

There are a lot of blogs that do lists by month or things that they are anticipating, but I wanted something more comprehensive and tailored to my own tastes so I had to make it myself. I also wanted something that would be super flexible, visual, but also easy to update and re-organize, all while being connected to a broader web of note-taking and tracking.

Now that I have these spaces, itâ€™s also become a place to track what Iâ€™ve watched, and start to formulate ranked lists that will lead to my end of year Top Tens. As a bonus, because of the flexibility Kinopio offers, I can carve out a little room in the TV space to show a little weekly schedule of whatâ€™s currently airing and on what day.

## What are some important parts of a media tracking space?

[Tagging](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/tags/) has been a wonderful way to keep track of all of the shows and movies over the years and where else I might have touched upon them in another space.

If I talk about a show or movie in another space, or log when Iâ€™ve watched it in my journals, I can use the tag to be able to cross-reference and see the history of my viewing, where else it might have come up, and then easily jump to those other spaces.

## How do you collect and organize info on your space?

[Headers and color](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/styling-cards/) were two things I never thought I would ever really use on Kinopio, but they have been critical to organizing the spaces.

I can use the Headers to lay the space out and organize it in a way thatâ€™s relatively easy to track and follow.

I even use colors a little bit in the headings for decoration, but where colors have been even more useful is in color coding shows or movies, by my interest level and if Iâ€™ve watched it yet or am planning to.

## Any other tips of advice?

The alignment buttons have been absolutely critical to keeping my sanity and spaces neatly organized. I can quickly move things around and reorder on a whim without having to worry about organization. Then with a quick highlight and press of the alignment button, poof, neatly organized once again.

Lastly, I canâ€™t talk about these spaces without talking about [Links](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/backlinks/). Links have allowed me to build a personal wiki around media and my life. Both my TV and Movie space are linked to in my [Media hub space](https://kinopio.club/-the-central-hub-nTfUzCV1vnLedTHiWGWcE), which links to other media spaces, and is also linked to from even more spaces.

With the new [sidebar](https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1527978737731608576) itâ€™s now super convenient to bounce around spaces, going higher or deeper in the hierarchy, making connections, and keeping track of things in a detailed, but easy manner.
