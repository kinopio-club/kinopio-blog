<p>Hi friends,</p>

<p>I recently got back from a two week trip to France, the first vacation-like thing Iâ€™ve had in years. The best thing we ate wasnâ€™t a fancy croissant, or an upscale Parisian dish, but some wild blackberries growing by the side of the road after a short hike. </p>

</p>

<p>Is it just me or do the way berries grow kind of resemble connected cards? Maybe it's just me? Maybe art imitates life?</p>
