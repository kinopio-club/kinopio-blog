<p>Hi Friends, </p>

<p>The goal of these Kinopio bulletins is to be interesting. That usually means talking about some cool new feature or a <a href="https://kinopio.club/pop-up-shop-u9XxpuIzz2_LvQUAayl65">pop-up shop</a> â€“ but this bulletin has neither. </p>

<p>Kinopio spaces are like little spatial worlds, except for some people theyâ€™re not so little. You mightâ€™ve noticed that in big spaces with ~250+ cards, things start to slowww down.</p>

</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been working on this problem for the last two weeks. Performance tuning is kind of a dark art, you find slow routines and you squeeze milliseconds out of them â€“ and sometimes that helps, but not enough this time. </p>

<p>So now Iâ€™m on stage 2: full on data-model surgery. The heart is out on the operating table and every artery and vein is being cleaned out and reconnected.</p>

<p>Early results are extremely promising. Iâ€™m looking forward to having a new light-weight race-spec Kinopio to share with you next time.</p>
