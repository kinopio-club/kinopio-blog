Hi friends,

So for the last couple months I've been experimenting with cross-posting all my social media posts to see what kind of energy I'd get back on each site. I figured I had nothing to lose. (Except my time, and sanity).

I occasionally got good feedback and discussions on ùïè (general audiences), Mastodon (technical), and on Posts.cv (designers). But I only ever got crickets on Bluesky, Instagram, Threads, and LinkedIn, so I probably won't use those [anymore](https://kinopio.club/social-media-plezJhK98WCzh52YOYSLR).

Thankfully, besides word-of-mouth, what seems to work best is old-fashioned blogging and email newsletters (like this one). Every time I blog on my [personal site](https://pketh.org), 200~ new people decide to subscribe to new posts by email, which is really cool. As you might imagine, a blog post takes a lot more time/effort to write than a Tweet ('ùïècretion'?), but it also feels more _real_ somehow.

To spend even more time in blog-world, I'm thinking of adding a simple comments system. I've roughly [planned it out](https://kinopio.club/-spec-adding-comments-to-my-static-blog-jekyll--uaNk92XDHebjn_336IL-8), let me know what you think.

And as always, thanks for reading ‚òª
