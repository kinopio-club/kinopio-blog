  <p>In theory, every marketing website has the same job, &quot;hey this thing can help you, you should use it&quot;. </p>

  <p>But writing, designing, and building the new <a href="https://help.kinopio.club/about">About Kinopio page</a> really took it out of me. </p>

  </p>

  <p>I started with writing. If I can make something compelling in a .txt file, that's a good place to build from. Strangely, I think clearly describing what a product does is probably hardest for the person who made it. But all the <a href="https://kinopio.club/ideas-for-growing-kinopio-WjASP_gR0dWatK1Avy_rJ">feedback</a> I've gotten from you has been super helpful in figuring out what themes to focus on.</p>

  <p>Aesthetically, I wanted the page to feel approachable, but also memorable and characterful. Just like with Kinopio itself, I wanted the way you interact with this page to have a little extra somethin' somethin'. </p>

  <p>So, the page paints itself. Kind of like I'm sitting on your shoulder and I'm saying &quot;hey check this out, and also this part is really cool&quot;.</p>

  <p>To build auto-painting, I wrote some code that <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/magic-paint.js">recorded</a> my paint strokes, and then transforms the position and timing of those <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/recorded-strokes.js">recorded strokes</a> to <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-help/blob/master/assets/js/auto-paint.js">auto-paint</a> them next to specific elements on the page.</p>

  <p>Honestly, this was kind of a nightmare. I should've chosen an easier profession, like navy seal.</p>

  <p>With all that out of the way, I'm catching up on support issues next, and continuing on the path towards a splashy new ProductHunt launch. Hopefully we'll be talking about that next time. </p>
