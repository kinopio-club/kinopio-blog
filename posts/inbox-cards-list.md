# Implementation Notes

The idea for this feature came from a forum [thread](https://club.kinopio.club/t/how-to-combine-kinopio-and-obsidianmd/1040/33) that started as being about how Kinopio could be integrated into Obsidian.

But after peeling the layers back a bit, the fundamental desire seemed to be capturing text from a linear text document (which the inbox could already do), and then being able to place those thoughts in a specific space for processing and thinking through.

> p.s. If Obsidian gains traction on their proposed .canvas file format, it'd be trivial to add support for it in Kinopio
