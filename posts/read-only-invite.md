Invite someone to view a private space – but not edit it.

`Share → Invite → Read Only`

(Invitees don't need an account)

## Backstory

Over the last year, I received a lot of requests for the ability to give read-only access to private spaces by people wanting to share reference diagrams and plans at work. I love that people are using Kinopio for both personal and work stuff. I think more than being a consumer tool, or a professional tool, Kinopio is a place you can live in and think in, whatever the context.

Adding extra business-y features without adding friction for everyone else is a delicate tightrope. To that end, a big part of this work was also redesigning the Share menu to present a new way to invite people, without making things annoying or confusing for everyone else.
