<p>Continuing from the last bulletin, I spent the last couple weeks working on making every interaction, like loading spaces, scrolling, painting, dragging and editing cards 2-5x faster and more responsive. </p>

<p>I also wanted to ship something fun this week, so I reached out to <a href="https://www.joifulton.com">Joi Fulton</a> about licensing some of her work for a new frame,</p>

<p>I think it turned out really well. Itâ€™s got spooky seasonal vibes but I hope you can use it year round too.</p>

<p>My original plan was to email bulletins like this every two weeks â€“ a nice regular update on Kinopio and the community. But the reality has been that these emails go out whenever the stars align. </p>

<p>It gets a little stressful when itâ€™s been a while tbh.</p>

<p>So I want to address this by creating a new weekly email that lists new Explore spaces, info related to your â™¥s, and whatever else I come up with. </p>

<p>I havenâ€™t designed it yet so if youâ€™ve got any thoughts, ideas, or if you know any really great emails I should look at, please let me know.</p>
