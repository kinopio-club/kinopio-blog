<p>Kinopio is on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kinopio-2-0">Product Hunt today</a>,</p>

<p>This is my second time launching on Product Hunt. The first time was honestly pretty stressful. But the exposure, support – and eventually new customers – was a much needed help.</p>

<p>Spreading the word is the hardest part of making Kinopio sustainable, so if you’d like to help out, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kinopio-2-0">come through</a>. It's really appreciated!</p>
