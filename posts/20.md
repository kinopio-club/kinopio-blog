<p>I‚Äôve noticed that people use Kinopio in two broadly different ways,</p>

<ul>
  <li>More introverted: for personal thinking, organization, and research. Creating spaces with connected ideas primarily for your own understanding</li>
  <li>More extroverted: to share cool new ideas and stuff you like. Creating spaces with aesthetic layouts, backgrounds and colors for other people to enjoy</li>
</ul>

<p>Social-ness isn‚Äôt a boolean or linear thing though. Everyone has introverted and extroverted qualities and use-cases, so I think it‚Äôs really cool that Kinopio is helpful across the spectrum.</p>

<p>But this also creates split priorities,</p>

<p>Some people want more Roam-y features that are better for deep-work and deep-thinking. Other people want more Figma-esque features that make their spaces more customizable and cooler looking. </p>

<p>Expanding on my last blog post about <a href="https://pketh.org/how-i-build.html">How I Build</a>, sometimes I have to take a step back and ask myself ‚Äúwhat feels like the ‚ÄòKinopio‚Äô thing to do‚Äù? What are the things that other tools can't do, or aren‚Äôt designed to do well?</p>

<p>It's a longer path to walk, but I think there's still room in the world for new interactions that are meaningful and memorable.</p>

<p>It's still winter outside, but inside Kinopio I think it's time for spring cleaning and bug fixing</p>
