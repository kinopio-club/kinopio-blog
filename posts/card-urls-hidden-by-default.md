When you paste into cards,  URLs are now be hidden by default so that just the preview info displays. (When needed, you can use the 'URL' button to show the full URL).

Thank you all for the feedback on how you've been using Kinopio so far.

Originally requested on the [community forum](https://club.kinopio.club/t/global-setting-for-hide-urls-by-default/1082/9) as an optional a user setting, and evolved to become the default for everyone.
