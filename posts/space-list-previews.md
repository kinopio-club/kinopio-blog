Do you have lots of spaces, like 100s or 1000s (like I do)? Little preview images next to each of your spaces, and community spaces, make it easier to visually find the space you're looking for.

## Power-User Tips/Caveats

- The image previews are created at the same time as the larger [Linked Space Previews](https://blog.kinopio.club/posts/linked-space-previews/) used for link unfurls on Slack and social media. 
- These previews are generated when you open one of your spaces, when you change the background, and when you open your spaces list. Because of this, older spaces that haven't been visited in the last couple months won't have a preview image until you open them again.
