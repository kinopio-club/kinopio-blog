    Lately, I've been thinking about this small farmhouse I found in the woods, surrounded only by acres of empty fields. It's all boarded up and there are never any snow prints in the ground around it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Put in some windows, set up some internet, and I could totally see myself living out here surrounded by nothing but trees and air and snow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone who's seen the house thinks it's haunted, and that there's something wrong with me. I'll bet you get me though?

    The big release this week is desktop zooming. It feels so natural, you might feel like it's been part of Kinopio from the beginning.

    I haven't gotten to writing that new blog post yet. Things do seem to come up. But here's hoping ~
