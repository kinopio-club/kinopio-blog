<p>When I send these bulletin emails I kind of enjoy the out of office auto-responder messages I get back. </p>

<p>The European ones,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm away on vacation for the next month, I‚Äôll reply when I‚Äôm back‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The American ones,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of office this week, if this is urgent please message Betty or call me anytime‚Äù </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentally and geographically, I‚Äôm definitely on workaholic team America. I enjoy working on Kinopio, sculpting this clay-like thing into existence, key by key. But the pressure to grow the business and be successful is always back there, lurking in the background, not so subtly.</p>

<!-- üõ∂ -->

<p>It took me about three weeks to rewrite Kinopio‚Äôs low-level modules to <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1450858030506168323">improve performance 2-5x</a>. But surprise surprise ‚Äì when you change everything, lots can break. Thanks to all the helpful bug reports I received and fixed over the last couple weeks, Kinopio is now pretty stable again.</p>

<p>Besides that, some new stuff snuck in too.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1461343999713759235">Unsubscribe from space notifications</a> to receive only the emails you want</li>
<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1458510455668977666">share dialog lists everyone</a> who added cards to a space</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1456272946184425477">RSS feeds</a> to keep up with spaces and Explore</li>
<li>Pasting a URL into a card creates <a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1455206616987574280">nicer link previews</a> with more accurate site info</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/KinopioClub/status/1460344395547484160">Card Overlap Indicators</a> help covered and stacked cards stand out</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Weekly Review Emails, deferred from the last bulletin</li>
  <li>Promotional outreach to get the word out about Kinopio. Recommendations for makers, influencers, productivity people, etc. that you think I should reach out to would be really helpful</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoyed the flower petal nav on <a href="https://wildflowers.garden">wildflowers.garden</a>. Besides the whimsy, this is one of those rare times where content and interface are deeply connected.</p>
