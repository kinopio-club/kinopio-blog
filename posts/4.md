  So I found out that I had an eye infection which was blurring my vision. Yuck, but I'm already healing up.

  When you can't see well, you realize just how much we rely on shape, size and position to use computer interfaces.

<p>
  TIL Having eyesight is pretty cool.

<!-- ðŸ›¶ -->
<p>
  I added new ways to organize things in large spaces
  <ul>
    <li>
      Shift-drag cards to move them straight horizontally or vertically
    </li>
    <li>
      Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-A to select all cards below your cursor
    </li>
    <li>
      Added more alignment options after paint selecting cards
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Sticking to the
  <a href="https://kinopio.club/-kinopio-roadmap-6TRE21gchHI7alHLuwzd5">Roadmap</a>, looks like I'm writing a new blog post soon (maybe something about ~inspiration?)
</p>
<p>
  p.s. I'm still looking for relevant creators with small audiences to reach out too. If you know anyone let me know :)

  <!--  After that,
  starting work on improving kinopio on mobile, and possibly paving the way for a native iOS app -->
