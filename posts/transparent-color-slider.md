More creative controls to get your cards looking *just* right (also works with boxes, and background tint color too)

# Implementation Notes

While [building Ways to pass time inside this room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5yqp_L3pxM), I heavily relied on the secret ability to use `transparent` as the card color to improve the presentation of cards on [this space](https://kinopio.club/ways-to-pass-time-inside-this-room-ait5GV1oTkV9fu026GUWr).

I figured more people would benefit knowing about this feature so I updated the color picker to add a `transparent` shortcut button

It was cool that more people knew about transparency, but I didn't love how the extra button seemed to make the ColorPicker dialog feel overly technical. Ben in the [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/h2sR45Nby8) suggested a slider, and I think that approach turned out great. 

In addition to a couple other color math functions, I'm using [colord](https://github.com/omgovich/colord) here to convert colors from hex to rgba and apply the alpha channel dynamically.
