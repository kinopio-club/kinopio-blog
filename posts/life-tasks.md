## Why make a life tasks space?

I created my space because I needed a place to plan and decide what to fix or build next. It's basically my 'home' space on Kinopio.

Whenever I've used traditional todo list apps, I'd inevitably hit a point where it feels like I'm buried under the weight of an infinite task list â€“ that's usually when I'd usually start looking for another app, then repeat the problem all over again.

My favorite thing about using a space for this instead is how the clutter of this space reflects the clutter of my mind. When I organize my space, it feels like I'm organizing my mind.

## What are some important parts of life tasks?

Your personal space should reflect your personality. Besides tasks and ideas, add personal photos, a [background](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/changing-space-background/), and cool [images](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/adding-images-to-cards/) that inspire you right now.

Your system doesn't have to make sense to anyone but you, and you can use [privacy](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/privacy-options/) options to make it as private or public as you want.

## How do you collect and organize info on your space?

![](https://help.kinopio.club/assets/posts/guides/life-tasks5.png)

I'd start by just writing out all the tasks floating inside my head. Use [checkboxes](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/checkbox-cards/) to turn the short-term actions into tasks.

I like to keep my urgent cards in the top left where I always see them, and move longer-term cards outwards where I'll later decide whether to turn them into tasks, break them down into projects, or just remove them.

## Any other tips of advice?

Besides all that, every morning I'll use card frames and colors to emphasize what I want to tackle today.

If your space starts to feel a bit cramped, that's a good sign. Yesterday's aspirations can become tomorrow's burdens so it's a good idea to occasionally prune ideas and tasks that you don't want to do anymore. [Paint selecting](https://help.kinopio.club/posts/selecting-and-bulk-actions/) a bunch of things you no longer want to do and removing them is really satisfying, cathartic even.
