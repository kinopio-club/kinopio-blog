# Implementation Notes

When you start to accumulate lots of spaces, even if you name things well, it's natural to forget where exactly you put some fleeting thought. To ship this first release out to people as quickly as I could, the search is a very straightforward 'substring' search, sorted in order of cards more recently updated. 

So for now, there's no "did you mean" type sophistication. Additionally the search will only return cards that you yourself created, so content created by collaborators won't show up here. 

That said, now that I can evaluate the real demand and usecases, global search will get even better from here.
