I've been [collecting fonts](https://kinopio.club/fonts-and-wordmark-6n5memHYV0K1qmeUcX2Fs) over the last year. But there was a *lot* of trial and error needed to find the ones that worked well together, and could set an atmosphere while still being flexible enough to cover every use-case.

These aren't the standard google/adobe fonts that you'll find everywhere else – each one is special in it's own way:

## Apris

Foundry: [Schick Toikka](https://www.schick-toikka.com/apris), Berlin, Germany

Funky, energetic, channeling the spirit of 1970s design, Apris has a real _"let's go!"_ kind of energy.

## Gaya

Foundry: [Writtenshape](https://www.writtenshape.com/fonts/gaya), Paris, France

Wavy, soft, and inviting, if you were writing with a pen filled with honey you might end up with something as sweet as Gaya.

## GroteskRemix

Foundry: [bb-bureau](https://www.bb-bureau.fr), Paris, France

Not gonna lie, I discovered this font from the end credits of [Mr. and Mrs. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._%26_Mrs._Smith_(2024_TV_series)) on amazon. GroteskRemix is unlike anything else, but in the right contexts, especially on dark backgrounds, it can be really sophisticated and technical.

(p.s. don't sleep on the `## h2` variant of GroteskRemix)

## GT America

Foundry: [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america), Lucerne, Switzerland

I also wanted to provide a modern, professional sans-serif font that's ideal for use in serious planning and work spaces. It's authoritative without being authoritarian – a surprisingly fine line in the world of fonts.

## Microgramma

Foundry: [URW Type Foundry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgramma_%28typeface%29), Turin, Italy

Technical, space-age, utopic – microgramma is from a past where people were optimistic about the potential of new technology to improve our lives, like microchips and microwaves. If you're trying to make a better world, it's a fun place to start.

## Migra

Foundry: [Pangram Pangram](https://pangrampangram.com/products/migra)

Migra has brush-like edges like the kind you'd find in ornate monastic texts – but because those edges are also geometric, it works well in modern spaces too.

## Recoleta

Foundry: [Latinotype](https://www.latinotype.com), Chile, Peru

This is the previous/current default header font so it's probably the most familiar. It's still a great choice that really shines in personal spaces.

## Shinka-Mono

Foundry: [Aeiou Tools](https://aeiou.tools/typeface/shinka-mono), Passenans, France

Originally, Kinopio used a version of Osaka-Mono that I hand-customized to work better with english punctuation as it's only font. But I eventually let it go so the app would work better for people in Asia and other non-latin countries. Shinka-Mono, designed to look like the english glyphs in Japanese fonts, is reminiscent of those experimental days.

Monospace fonts aren't just for programmers, they're for every creator.
