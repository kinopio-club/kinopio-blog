  <p>Waiting for yet another plane, to yet another location. This time, to New Jersey. Supposedly this is the last move I'll have to make in a while, but it's hard for me to believe. I've got PTSD like a rescue stray, maybe you can adopt me.</p>

  <p>My dream is to spend a whole day in a dark cave nice. Cloistered away, with no obligations, moving tasks, and internet to set up.</p>

  <p>Maybe Iâ€™ll pick mushrooms of the dark stone walls and just type things all day while I munch.</p>

    Card seach is pretty handy for seeing what's new and jumping around your busy spaces. Also, I explored small game-making in Kinopio with

    Because of all the aformentioned life moving slogs, it's probably not going to be a super productive week. Up next though is improved navigation/jumping between spaces.
