  <p>This month and next, I'm living in a magical attic in still-sometimes-snowing Windsor, Ontario.</p>

  <p>I found that I love living in the downtown of small towns. Having clean air, chill vibes, lots of space, but still being a short walk to the one quaint shopping street, with the one (or two) quaint cafÃ©s is really all I need in life.</p>

<!--   <p>Unfortunately, I have to move back to NYC so I'm being pulled back into the sludge of beaurocracy. All I really want now is to be able to spend all of my days focused on Kinopio.</p>

  <p>Here's a photo of a creepy cat I met â€“ bet you can't find him though:

    Last week, I focused on small enhancements that make everyday use nicer â€“ like file uploads, svg image support, and glowing card connectors. These small details are my favorite kinds of updates.

    I also wrote about how I've collected and used

    It's tax season, and immigration issues are compounding the complexity. Every accountant I reached out to ghosted me so I'm <a href="https://kinopio.club/n8HfwGead6o3sC71X98Vx">doing it myself</a>. Anxiety is high, but with enough planning, all things are possible ðŸ¤ž
