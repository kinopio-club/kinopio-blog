# Implementation Notes

This replaces the previous minimap feature which was implemented by drawing a representation of the cards and connections to a single `<canvas>`. It was a totally seperate renderer optimized for high speed and low interactivity, basically like a micro-Figma inside of Kinopio.

While the minimap demo-ed really well, I decided to remove it because:

- It would have required significant work to get it working with recent performance optimizations
- Development of the minimap predated zooming, and a fully zoomed out space does basically the same thing
- The minimap wasn't actually used much by people IRL
- It's one less button/mode and less code to maintain

I guess the lesson to myself for the future: It's feels bad saying no, but it feels worse building cool-looking big features that very few people very rarely use
