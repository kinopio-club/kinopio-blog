## Implementation Notes

This replaces the previous youtube-only embed support with a general solution that works for any site supported by [iFramely](https://iframely.com/try).

The reason you have to click play to start the embed is primarily for privacy and performance reasons. When loaded, most embeds execute dozens of tracking scripts. The last thing I want is for spaces to slowdown as you add links to them.
