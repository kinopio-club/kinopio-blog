# Implementation Notes

Raycast Extensions are each little self contained `React/Typescript` web-apps which you build locally and then submit to a Github Repo as a new folder. There are automated review stages that ensure your `package.json` file has all the right info, among other things. And then there's a manual review where a staff member checks your app to see if it works.

It's all conceptually straightforward and would work well with a future Raycast for Windows and Linux.

That said, `React` is still as annoying as I remember (it's almost as if it was made by facebook to solve problems that mostly affect facebook), and as a first time `Typescript`-er I had trouble getting my code to stop throwing irrelevant type errors for basic things. It would've saved me a lot of time if I could've just wrote regular javascript instead :(
